    <h2> Theories That Einstein Has Made: </h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Theory of Relativity</strong><br> The Theory of Relativity has two theories—Special Relativity (1905) and General Relativity (1915). Special Relativity
            shows that the laws of physics are the same for all non-accelerating observers, and the speed of light in a vacuum is constant for everyone, 
            regardless of their motion. <br> The Theory of Relativity it redefined space, time, gravity, and energy, forming the bedrock of modern physics, 
            cosmology (explaining black holes, the universe's history), and enabling technologies like GPS by correcting for relativistic time shifts, 
            while also underpinning nuclear physics and particle accelerators. </li>

        <li><strong>Photoelectric Effect</strong><br> The Photoelectric Effect was first observed by German physicist Heinrich Hertz in 1887. Albert Einstein
        solved the theory. The Photoelectric Effect is when light (photons) hits a material, usually a metal, and knocks electrons (photoelectrons) loose, 
        creating an electric current, demonstrating light's particle nature. <br> The Photoelectric Effect is significant by proving light's particle 
        nature (photons), launching quantum mechanics, explaining how light energy is quantized, and enabling technologies like solar cells, digital 
        cameras, and light sensors by converting light into electricity.  It revealed light isn't just a wave but also discrete packets of energy, 
        overturning classical physics and forming the basis for modern quantum understanding and applications. It bridged classical physics and quantum 
        theory, validating light's dual nature and powering countless technologies by directly converting photons into usable electric current. </li>

        <li><strong> Brownian Motion </strong><br> Brownian Motion was first described in detail by Scottish botanist Robert Brown in 1827, who observed 
        the random jiggling of pollen grains in water, although scientists like Jan Ingen-Housz had noted it earlier. Albert Einstein later provided the 
        crucial atomic explanation in 1905. Albert Einstein solved Brownian motion by explaining the jiggling of visible particles as the result of 
        countless, unseen water/fluid molecules randomly colliding with them, proving atoms exist and linking microscopic atomic motion to macroscopic 
        heat phenomena (thermodynamics), providing strong evidence for atomic theory and allowing calculation of Avogadro's number and molecular size. <br>
        Brownian Motion is significant by providing crucial evidence for the existence of atoms and molecules, explaining random particle movement through 
        molecular collisions, and forming the basis for understanding diffusion, osmosis, and colloidal systems. Its significance extends to diverse 
        fields like finance (stock modeling), biology (cellular processes, disease spread), and technology (drug delivery, energy), demonstrating how 
        random forces in one area mirror patterns in others. Brownian motion reveals that seemingly random, chaotic movements at the microscopic level have 
        predictable mathematical patterns, providing a universal model for many complex systems. </li>

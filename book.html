    <h2> Books That Einstein Has Written: </h2>
    <ol>
        <li><i> Relativity : The Special and the General Theory </i><br> By Albert Einstein <br> This book summarizes Einstein's revolutionary ideas about 
            space, time, and gravity for a general audience, explaining how Special Relativity connects space and time (spacetime) and posits the constant 
            speed of light for all observers, leading to mass-energy equivalence (\(E=mc^{2}\)); then, General Relativity extends this to include gravity, 
            describing it not as a force but as the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy, fundamentally changing our understanding of the 
            universe's structure and dynamics. The book uses accessible language, thought experiments, and minimal math to guide readers through the 
            concepts of relative motion, time dilation, spacetime curvature, and the universe as a whole. </li>

        <li><i> Ideas and Opinions </i><br> By Albert Einstein <br> This book is about Albert Einstein's collection of essays, speeches, and letters, 
            offering insights into his views on science (relativity, atomic energy), politics (pacifism, socialism, world government), religion (cosmic 
            spirituality), humanism (ethics, education), and his philosophical views on life, showcasing his brilliant mind beyond physics and revealing 
            his deep commitment to humanity, reason, and peace amidst rising nationalism. </li>

        <li><i>The Evolution of Physics</i><br> By Albert Einstein and Leopold Infeld <br> This book traces physics' journey from Newton to the 20th 
            century, explaining key concepts like mechanics, field theory, relativity, and quanta without complex math, relying instead on thought 
            experiments and real-world analogies (cars, rollercoasters) to demystify the growth of ideas about reality for a general audience, showcasing 
            humanity's struggle to understand the universe and defending objective reality against emerging quantum ideas. </li>
